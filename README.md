# motor
A wide variety of motor command scripts in different formats

Attached are the following items:

1. **Fork_w_Hall -** this is a script that moves a servo when the hall effect sensor detects a magnetic field. The hall effect sensor output is HIGH or LOW. 
2. **attempt2.... -** this is the script that ran in the video of the rover moving on my kitchen floor
3. **attempt3.... -** this script allows us to control the rover over a phone or computer with bluetooth. I was not able to test it before frying my components, but I am 90% confident it would have worked as planned.
4. **simple.... -** this is a document with highlighted information on the motor controllers. This will be useful when coding because it lets us know when HEX commands to send to controllers.
 
The files attached are Arduino scripts. If you can't open them, the Arduino IDE is FOSS. You can download it and then open. You may even be able to open them on Arduino's online IDE, not sure though, I haven't used that.
